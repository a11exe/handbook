[#linux]

### Linux data streams
| Stream        | number | Description  |
|---------------|--------|--------------|
| stdin | 0      | It stands for standard input, and is used for taking text as an input. |
| stdout | 1      | It stands for standard output, and is used to text output of any command you type in the terminal |
| stderr | 2      | It stands for standard error |

```
$ ls -laH > myfile.txt // redirect stdout to file
$ ls -laH 1> myfile.txt // redirect stdout to file using stream number
$ ls -la ddd 2> error.txt // redirect stderr to file
$ $ psql tecmintdb < tecmintdb.sql
```

### Linux piping commands
The pipe is used to combine two or more commands
```
$ ls | grep file.txt
```

### Linux commands
format linux command: `command keys arguments`

`id` - id command in Linux is used to find out user and group names and numeric IDâ€™s (UID or group ID) of the current user or any other user in the server. This command is useful to find out the following information as listed below:

* User name and real user id.
* Find out the specific Users UID.
* Show the UID and all groups associated with a user.
* List out all the groups a user belongs to.
* Display security context of the current user.pwd - print working directory.
* The Absolute path always starts from the root directory (/). A relative path starts from the current directory.

`ls` - (list) show list of all files and dirs. -l long format, -a show all files (inculde hidden that starts with dot .)
ls -l displays the files and folders with permission bits. _If the line starts with a -, it's a file, if it's a directory, it starts with a d_

```
$ ls -1 // display One File Per Line Using
$ ls -lah // long + hidden + human readable 
$ ls -lt // older files based on last modification time
$ ls -ltr // same as above in reverse order
```

`touch` It is used to create, change and modify the timestamps of a file. If file is not exists it creates a file without any content.
```
$ touch test
$ touch /tmp/test.txt
$ touch test1 test2 test3 test4 test5
$ touch test{1,2,3,4,5}
$ touch -a fileName // change only access time
$ touch -m fileName // change only modification time
$ touch -d "17 Mar 2023" Geek.txt
$ touch -r second_file_name first_file_name // to use the timestamp of another file
```

`rm` (remove) command is used to remove objects such as files, directories, symbolic links and so on
```
$ rm a.txt
$ rm b.txt c.txt
$ rm -i d.txt // interractive 
$ rm -f e.txt // force for write protected
$ rm -r dir // delete all the files and sub-directories recursively of the parent directory
```

`rmdir` (remove dir) useful when you want to remove the empty directories from the filesystem in Linux

```
$ rmdir mydir1 mydir2 mydir3
$ rmdir -p mydir1/mydir2/mydir3/...../mydirN // including subdirectories
```

`mkdir` (make dir) allows the user to create directories

```
$ mkdir -p first/second/third // create parent if necessary
```

`history` command is used to view the previously executed command.

```
$ history 5
$ history | grep chpasswd
$ history -d 1996 // remove command 1996
$ history -c // clean whole history
$ history | tail // last command 
```

`cat` (concatenate) It reads data from the file and gives its content as output

```
$ cat file_name
$ cat file_name1 file_name2
$ cat -n file_name // view content preceding with line number
$ cat > newfile_name // create a file and add content
$ cat filename-whose-contents-is-to-be-copied > destination-filename // copy content
$ cat -s file_name // suppress repeated empty lines
$ cat file1 >> file2 // append content
$ tac file_name // display content in reverse order
```

`lsof` command stands for (List Of Open File). This command provides a list of files that are opened. 
Basically, it gives the information to find out the files which are opened by which process.

```
$ lsof
$ lsof -u username
$ lsof -p process ID
$ lsof -p ^process ID // all other process
$ lsof -R // parent process id
$ lsof -D directory path
$ lsof -i // files opened by network connections
```
