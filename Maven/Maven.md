## Clear maven cache
Our local Maven repositories are stored in different locations based on the operating system. Also, as the .m2 directory is likely to be hidden, weâ€™ll need to change the directory properties in order to display it.

In Windows, the default location is:
```
C:\Users\<user_name>\.m2
```
And on the Mac:
```
/Users/<user_name>/.m2
```
Linux:
```
/home/<user_name>/.m2
```

## External settings
IntelljIdea -> Settings -> Maven -> Use settings file

## Build specific module
```shell
$ mvn clean install -pl module1,module2 -am
```
or exclude
```shell
$ mvn clean install -pl '!module1, !module2'
```

## Skip tests
The Maven `-DskipTests` option skips the test execution while still compiling the test folder:
```shell
$ mvn clean install -DskipTests
```
Additionally, we can skip the test execution and not even compile them by using the `-Dmaven.test.skip=true` option:
```shell
$ mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

## Offline mode
Maven makes several round trips to the server during a build, for instance, for dependency resolution and plugin download. 
In particular, it will check for new snapshot updates every time. We can avoid that by going into offline mode:
```shell
$ mvn clean install -o
```
