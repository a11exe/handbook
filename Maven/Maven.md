## Clear maven cache
Our local Maven repositories are stored in different locations based on the operating system. Also, as the .m2 directory is likely to be hidden, weâ€™ll need to change the directory properties in order to display it.

In Windows, the default location is:
```
C:\Users\<user_name>\.m2
```
And on the Mac:
```
/Users/<user_name>/.m2
```
Linux:
```
/home/<user_name>/.m2
```

## External settings
IntelljIdea -> Settings -> Maven -> Use settings file
